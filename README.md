The safety-shift-plot library shows changes in lab measures, vital signs and other related measures over the course of a clinical trial. The library is built using [Webcharts](https://github.com/RhoInc/Webcharts) and [D3](https://www.d3js.org). 

See the [wiki](https://github.com/RhoInc/safety-shift-plot/wiki) for more details.
